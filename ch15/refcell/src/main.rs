// Interior mutability is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to
// mutate data even when there're immutable references to that data; this
// is disallowed by the borrowing rules.
// To mutate data, the pattern uses `unsafe` code inside a data structure
// to bend Rust's usual rules governing mutation and borrowing.

// RefCell<T> represents single ownership over the data it holds. With
// references and Box<T>, the borrowing rule's invariant are enforced at
// compile time:
// - At any time, you can have either (but not both of) one mutable
// reference or any number of immutable references;
// - References must always be valid.
// With RefCell<T>, these invariants are enforced at runtime. With
// references, if you break the rule, you get compile error. With
// RefCell<T>, if you break the rule, your program will panic.

// The advantage of compile-time borrow check is to catch errors early
// in the compile time, so there's no runtime overhead.
// The advantage of runtime borrow check is to allow certain memory-safe
// scenarios, which were disallowed by compile-time checks. Static analysis
// by the Rust compiler is inherently conservative. If it cannot analyze
// some (possibly correct) code, it rejects it.
// If Rust accepts an incorrect program, then users cannot trust Rust; but
// if Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced,
// but nothing catastrophic will happen.
// RefCell<T> is useful when you're sure that your code follows the borrowing
// rules but the compiler is not able to understand and guarantee that.
// Similar to Rc<T>, RefCell<T> is for single-threaded program.

// Recap:
// - Rc<T> enables multiple owners of the same data; Box<T> and RefCell<T>
// have single owners.
// - Box<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time;
// Rc<T> allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; RefCell<T>
// allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
// - Because RefCell<T> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime,
// you can mutate the value inside the RefCell<T> even when the RefCell<T>
// is immutable.
// Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the interior mutability pattern. 

// Context: we want to test method LimitTracker::set_value. Thus, we need
// a "mock object" that implements Messenger trait.

    // How this works?
    // Methods `borrow` and `borrow_mut` are part of the safe API of RefCell<T>.
    // The `borrow` methods return a Ref<T>, and `borrow_mut` returns a 
    // RefMut<T>. Both types implement Deref.
    // Think of `borrow` as `&` and `borrow_mut` as `mut &`.
    // 
    // At runtime, the RefCell<T> keeps track of how many Ref<T> and RefMut<T>
    // smart pointers are currently active. When `borrow` is called, the
    // RefCell<T> increments its count on immutable borrows; When a Ref<T> value
    // goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just
    // like compile-time borrowing rules, RefCell<T> allows having many
    // immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any time.
    // If the rule is violated, the program will panic. 
    // Two implications of catching borrowing errors at runtime: 
    // 1. You may find a mistake later in the development process, and possibly
    // not until the code is deployed;
    // 2. A small runtime performance penalty.
