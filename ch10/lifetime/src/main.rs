// Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, the scope in which the reference is

    // When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for 
    // the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the 
    // parameters. If the reference returned does not refer to one of the 
    // parameters, it must refer to a value created within this function, 
    // which would be a dangling reference because the value will go out of 
    // scope at the end of the function.

    // Lifetime annotation in struct definition
    // So far we have defined structs that only contain owned fields. It's
    // possible to define structs that hold reference. This requires a lifetime
    // annotation on every reference field.

    // Lifetime elision rules: Rust compiler will try to analyze your program
    // and infer the lifetime. If your code fits into the pattern that Rust
    // compiler is aware of, you don't have to add lifetime annotations.

    // Lifetimes on functions/method parameters are "input lifetimes", while
    // lifetimes on return values are called "output lifetimes". Here're the
    // three rules:
    // The 1st rule is that each parameter that is a reference gets its own 
    // lifetime parameter. In other words, a function with one parameter gets 
    // one lifetime parameter: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32); a function with two 
    // parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: 
    // fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32); and so on.
    // The 2nd rule is if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, 
    // that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: 
    // fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
    // The 3rd rule is if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but 
    // one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime 
    // of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule 
    // makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are 
    // necessary.

    // Lifetime annotation in method definition
    // Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the 
    // impl keyword and then used after the struct’s name, because those 
    // lifetimes are part of the struct’s type.

    // The static lifetime
    // The 'static lifetime means the reference can live through the entire
    // lifetime of the program. All string slices have the 'static lifetime.
}


// Lifetime annotation in function signature
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // It's impossible to create a local str and return a reference to it. 
    // Because the value will be dropped when this function returns.

    // Without knowing whether x or y will be returned, we don't know whether
    // the return value will be a valid reference. The borrow checker doesn't 
    // know the relationship between the lifetime of x, y, and return value.
    
    // Lifetime annotations do NOT change how long any of the references live. 
    // Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a 
    // generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any 
    // lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter. Lifetime annotations 
    // describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to 
    // each other without affecting the lifetimes.

    // We want to express that all references (x, y, and return value) must
    // have the same lifetime.
    // The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime 'a, the 
    // function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that 
    // live at least as long as lifetime 'a. The function signature also tells 
    // Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at 
    // least as long as lifetime 'a. In practice, it means that the lifetime 
    // of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the 
    // smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in. This is the 
    // constraint we want Rust to enforce.
